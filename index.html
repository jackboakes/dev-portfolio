        <p> 
            Hey, I'm <b>Jack Boakes</b>, I aim to create the kind of moments for others that games have created for me.

        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am a final year Bachelor of Computer Science student with a passion for programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            My interests are in gameplay, graphics, tool and engines, but I am open to exploring new areas and collaborating on exciting projects.

                    <p> 
                        During my university capstone project, I developed a puzzle minigame for 
                        <a href="https://sbccq.org/stephanies-animal-rescue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephanie's Animal Rescue Secret Island</a>, in Unity 6.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In each level, a different set of constellations are hidden amongst randomly placed stars, encouraging players to search for the correct shapes.
                        Players connect stars to form constellation shapes by dragging between nodes.
                        Because the game was designed for children of all abilities, I implemented a hint system that, after a short period of inactivity, guides players towards the next correct star.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under the hood, each level is defined within a JSON, which includes the level number, the shape type and the number of filler stars.
                        Level generation was inspired from <a href="https://youtu.be/GcM9Ynfzll0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Path of Exile's predefined level generation</a>.

                    Snake was built as a personal project to strengthen my understanding of low-level programming and game architecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Originally I wrote the game as a console application in C but later added raylib to handle opening a window and graphics. 
                    I later refactored the project into modern C++17, applying best practices and using features like std::filesystem and std::string_view.
                <p>
                    The game's menu UI is built in immediate mode and keeps track of only one active element.
                    Player input is polled every frame and stored in a circular queue of size two, enabling responsive movements.
                    The high score is saved to a text file using std::fstream, and all sound effects and artwork were created from scratch by me.
