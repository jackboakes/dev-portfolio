                            During my university capstone project, I developed a puzzle minigame for

                        <p>
                            Players connect stars by dragging between nodes to form constellation shapes.
                            The game features eight levels with constellation shapes ranging from triangles to hexagons.
                            In each level, a different set of constellations are hidden amongst randomly placed stars, encouraging players to search.

                            I built Snake mostly because I was curious how simple games actually work under the hood. 
                            It started as a tiny C console program with no grahpics, and I kept improving it as I learned more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Later, I added raylib to handle window opening and graphics, since the project was pretty bare bones.
                            I decided to refactor the whole thing into modern C++ 17, to learn best practices and use features like std::filesystem and std::string_view.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I designed the game's UI from scratch as an immediate-mode interface, keeping track of only one active element at a time.
                            Player input is polled every frame and stored in a circular queue of size two, enabling responsive movements.
                            The high score is saved to a text file using std::fstream, and all sound effects and artwork were created from scratch by me.
